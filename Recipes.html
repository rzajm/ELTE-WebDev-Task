                The Espresso Martini is a sophisticated cocktail that combines
                the rich flavors of coffee with the smoothness of vodka and a
                hint of sweetness. It's made with vodka, coffee liqueur (such as
                Kahlúa), freshly brewed espresso, and sometimes a touch of
                simple syrup for sweetness. The ingredients are typically shaken
                with ice until well chilled and strained into a martini glass.
                The Espresso Martini offers a perfect balance of bold coffee
                flavor with the kick of alcohol, making it a popular choice for
                those looking for a caffeinated twist on a classic cocktail.
